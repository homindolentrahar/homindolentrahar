## Personal Website

I think it's the best time to build my own website, to show what projects I've worked on and dump all my learning notes. Tho I didn't like React's Code API so much, I'll try my best to at-least comprehend it a bit. Hope it doesn't turn out to be another unfinished-side-project.
